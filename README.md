# Tiny-Library
A very simple library, to display books you have or have not yet read. 

I present to you the very first "serious" front-end project I've ever created, using basic tools HTML, CSS and vanilla JS. I used different sources, such as developersmozilla and stackoverflow to help me with it and it took me roughly 7-8 days to finalize.
